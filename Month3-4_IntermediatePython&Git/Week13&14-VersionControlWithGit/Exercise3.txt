# Branching and Merging

# Step 1: Create a new branch
git branch new-feature
# This command creates a new branch named 'new-feature'

# Step 2: Switch to the new branch
git checkout new-feature
# This command switches to the 'new-feature' branch

# Step 3: Make changes and commit them
echo "This is a new feature." > feature.txt
# Create a new file named 'feature.txt' with some content

git add feature.txt
# Stage the 'feature.txt' file for the next commit

git commit -m "Add feature.txt"
# Commit the staged changes with a message

# Step 4: Switch back to the main branch
git checkout main
# This command switches back to the 'main' branch

# Step 5: Merge the new branch into the main branch
git merge new-feature
# This command merges the 'new-feature' branch into the 'main' branch

# Step 6: Delete the new branch (optional)
git branch -d new-feature
# This command deletes the 'new-feature' branch
